Shelly Scanner is an application aimed at monitoring and management of some IoT devices of the Shelly family. It provides an instant overview of all devices connected to the same network to which the computer is connected. The dashboard provides information such as wi-fi signal strength, cloud status, time elapsed since the last reboot (uptime), internal temperature (for devices that provide it) and meters values; it also allows to control the devices. Other useful functions, such as backup and restore of devices configuration, can then be accessed through the toolbar.
