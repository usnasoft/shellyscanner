Shelly Scanner is an application aimed at monitoring and managing most of the IoT devices of the Shelly family. It provides an instant overview of all devices connected to the same network to which the computer is connected. The dashboard provides information such as wi-fi signal strength, cloud status, time elapsed since the last reboot (uptime), internal temperature (for devices providing it), meters values and more; it also allows devices control. Other useful features, such as backup and restore of devices configuration, can easily be accessed through the toolbar.
